# DISCORD TTRPG SOUNDBOARD & BOTS
A soundboard to manage music and ambience during your discord TTRPG sessions. I have built this tool for my very own purpose so it is a bit shaky but I decided to share it if it can help someone. I know that some built-in or online solutions exist for this but sometimes nothing match exactly your needs so you have to get your hands dirty. You can use this tool as you want, copy it, fork it do as you want. If you do some improvments do no hesitate to share it whith me to ensure everybody can enjoy it. 

## Overview
### Technical aspects
The tool consists of 2 Discord music bots and a soundboard displayed in a web view. The soundboard allow you to control the music played by the bots throught the interface. The bots cannot be controlled throught the discord chat except for joining and leaving a voice channel. The idea is to have two bits to manage simulteanously music/ambience and the sound effects. But you can use the two bots in the way you want even just one if you prefer (just kick the other one from the vocal).

The bots are hosted with python and a Lavalink server (version 3.7.8).

### Use and customization
When you launch the tool (a combination of batch, jar and python script) it opens a Windows console and a webview. You can minimize the console you will probably have no use for it. The webview contain the soundboard.
